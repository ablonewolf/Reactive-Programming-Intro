/**
 * The DemonstrateMulticastDirectAllOrNothing class demonstrates the usage of a multicast {@link Sinks.Many} with the
 * {@code directAllOrNothing} backpressure strategy from Project Reactor.
 * It highlights how this strategy ensures that an emitted item is delivered to all subscribers simultaneously â€” or
 * not at all.
 * If any subscriber cannot accept the item (e.g., due to being slow or full), the emission fails for all subscribers.
 * <p>
 * This behavior makes the {@code directAllOrNothing} strategy suitable for scenarios where consistency across
 * subscribers
 * is critical, and partial delivery is not acceptable. However, it may result in dropped items if any subscriber
 * lags behind.
 * <p>
 * Key demonstrations include:<br>
 * 1. Creating a multicast sink using:
 * {@link Sinks#many()}.{@link Sinks.ManySpec#multicast()}.{@link Sinks.MulticastSpec#directAllOrNothing()}.<br>
 * 2. Subscribing a fast consumer (Sam) that receives all items when all subscribers are ready.<br>
 * 3. Subscribing a deliberately slow consumer (Jane) that introduces a delay using
 * {@link Flux#delayElements(Duration)},
 * demonstrating how it causes both subscribers to miss emissions.<br>
 * 4. Emitting a sequence of numbers and logging the result of each emission using
 * {@link Sinks.Many#tryEmitNext(Object)}.<br>
 * 5. Configuring system property {@code reactor.bufferSize.small} to control buffer size and better visualize the
 * effects of backpressure.
 * <p>
 * Dependencies:<br>
 * - Uses the {@link Util} class to create and configure subscribers with descriptive labels and custom logging.<br>
 * - Relies on SLF4J's {@link Logger} for logging emission results during execution.<br>
 * - Uses Java's {@link Duration} to simulate delayed processing for slow subscribers.<br>
 * - Leverages Reactor's {@link Flux} and {@link Sinks} API to model the reactive stream and manage manual emissions.
 * <p>
